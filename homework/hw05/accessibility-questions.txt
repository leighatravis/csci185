Please answer the following accessibility questions:

1. What accessibility corrections did you have to make?
I had to add alternative text to the images that were missing it, also add a language to the document, and correct the empty button errors. 


2. Do you think your website is usable if you turn off the CSS? Why or why not?
I do not think the website is usable if you turn off css because the button, layout and spacing in general would not look right and be confusing for a person to understand. 


3. Is your site is tabbable? In other words, without the use of the mouse, are all the links and buttons accessible using the tab key?
Yes, when you use the tab key on this website it scrolls through the artists displayed without having to use your mouse or click anything.
